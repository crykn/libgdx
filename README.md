## Cross-platform Game Development Framework
**[libGDX](https://libgdx.github.io) is a cross-platform Java game development framework based on OpenGL (ES) that works on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS and your WebGL enabled browser.** It provides a well-tried and robust environment for rapid prototyping and fast iterations. libGDX does not force a specific design or coding style on you, it rather gives you the freedom to create a game the way you like it.

## Open Source, Feature Packed and Offering a Big Third-party Ecosystem
libGDX is licensed under [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) meaning you can use it free of charge, without strings attached in commercial and non-commercial projects. We love to get (non-mandatory) credit in case you release a game or app using the framework! libGDX comes with batteries included. See our [showcase](https://libgdx.github.io/showcase/) for a selection of 2D and 3D games developed with it. 

libGDX also offers a very extensive third-party ecosystem. There are numerous [tools](https://libgdx.github.io/dev/tools/) and libraries that take a lot of work off the hands of developers. Take a look at [Awesome-libGDX](https://github.com/rafaskb/awesome-libgdx#readme) for a curated list of libGDX-centered libraries and a good starting point for anyone new in the libGDX world.

## Getting libGDX / Documentation
As we switched to Gradle, there's no need to download libGDX itself anymore. We also offer a [setup tool](https://libgdx.github.io/dev/#how-to-get-started-with-libgdx), which automatically creates a project for you and downloads everything necessary. See our **[website](https://libgdx.github.io/dev/setup/)** for instruction son how to get started or read our **[wiki](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki)**.

We also provide [Javadocs](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/docs/api/) online. The Javadocs are also bundled as source Jars with every libGDX distribution for consumption in your favorite IDE.

## Community & Contributing
You can follow the latest news about libGDX on the [blog](https://libgdx.github.io/news/). A good way to get in touch with our community is to join the official [libGDX Discord](https://discord.gg/6pgDK9F).

### Reporting Issues
Use the **[issue tracker](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues)** here on GitHub to report issues. Make sure you read the [Getting Help](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Getting-help) article that walks you through the process of properly reporting an issue.

### Working on the Code
libGDX has a strong developer community constantly improving the code base. We love to get any and all help we can. The [Contributing](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Contributing) article describes the process of helping libGDX to become even better. To contribute, you need to work with libGDX' sources directly, something normal users do not have to go through. The [Working with the Source](https://libgdx.github.io/dev/from_source/) article will give you directions.

You can also contribute financially to our infrastructure (build server, web server, test devices) via our [Patreon](http://patreon.com/libgdx)!

### Supported By
libGDX is supported by helpful 3rd parties via code contributions, free licenses, test devices and so forth. Make our supporters happy and visit their sites!
